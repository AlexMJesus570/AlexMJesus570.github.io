				<h4>About Me</h4>
				<p>My name is Alex Michael Jesus. I was born on June 28th 1990. I was lived in Jersey
				City, NJ until I was 12 years old. When I was 12 I moved with my family to Selinsgrove,
				PA. I always had a connection with the evolution of technology. I just never knew where to begin. I have
				tried many different courses throughout my life to find the right fit but realized that web
				development was my major interest. I can be creative in my own way. I am currently taking
				a Udemy course to become a full stack web developer.</p>
				<p>Below are some skill sets I am pretty good at, as of right now, and I do have my git hub
				link to my direct profile below. I am putting in my own fulltime hours into learning to become
				a full stack web developer. I will do some remote work if you are interested for a basic webpage 
				like this built from scratch, or if you are also a developer also and would like some help on your
				projects. </p>
